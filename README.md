🌍 Tyeis Travel — Luxury Travel Planning Website

Tyeis Travel is a beginner-level front-end web project designed to practice and demonstrate core web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project explores the concept of a luxury travel planning platform, allowing users to browse curated destinations, view hotel recommendations, experiment with a budget planner, and interact with a simulated chat interface.

This project is front-end only and focuses on layout, structure, and basic interactivity rather than full backend functionality.
